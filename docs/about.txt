I work on scaling DTC brands by applying first-principles thinking to email and retention
especially when things start to behave unpredictably at scale.
I’m the founder of EmailOptimize and Trustalytics.ai (currently in R&D), where my focus has
been on understanding how consumer trust, relevance, and behavior compound or decay over
time inside email systems.
Before that, I led email marketing at E2.Agency, worked across hundreds of ecommerce
brands, and spent years experimenting at the intersection of engineering, consumer behavior,
and retention.
I originally studied engineering in China, later pursued a Master’s in Engineering Management
in Australia, and became early-interested in quantifying consumer trust long before the tooling
existed to support it. Some ideas had to wait. Others became this work.
This perspective comes from watching the same failure pattern repeat itself across brands of
very different sizes.
Most email programs don’t fail.
They decay.
At first, everything looks fine. Revenue is still coming in. Campaigns still convert. Automations
are firing. Dashboards don’t show anything obviously broken.
But underneath the surface, relevance starts slipping.
Engagement thins out. Inbox trust weakens. You need to send a little more often to get the
same result. Then a little more. Then a lot more. At some point, performance becomes volatile,
not terrible, just unpredictable. Good weeks followed by inexplicable drops. Deliverability issues
that seem to come and go. Revenue that used to compound now has to be chased.
Most teams only react once the problem shows up clearly in the metrics.
By then, it’s already late. The inbox has learned how to treat you.
This is the phase I get pulled into.
I work with ecommerce brands often doing anywhere from $2M to $20M+ per year where email
and SMS already matter. These aren’t beginners. There’s usually an in-house team. Sometimes
an agency. Often both. On the surface, things are being executed correctly.
But results are flattening.
Or becoming fragile.
Or harder to explain month to month.
The common assumption is that the issue is tactical. Creative fatigue. Deliverability
infrastructure. Not enough flows. Too many flows. The wrong ESP. The wrong sending times.
The wrong subject lines.
In reality, those are rarely the root problem.
What’s breaking is the relevance of how inboxes and recipients respond to your behavior over
time.
Email is not a landing page.
It’s a behavioral system with memory.
When you scale volume faster than permission, automate without restraint, or optimize for clicks
without accounting for long-term signals, the system starts pushing back.
Quietly.
This is why so many teams end up stuck in the same loop: sending more to make up for
declining engagement, which accelerates the decline even further. Short-term lifts at the cost of
long-term fragility.
The lens I use for this work is simple, but unforgiving:
Delivered → Opened → Read → Taken Action
(You can read more about the DORTA framework here.)
If these layers aren’t respected in order, scale doesn’t create leverage.
It creates risk.
Most strategies jump straight to action clicks, conversions, revenue while assuming everything
upstream is stable.
It isn’t.
You can’t automate your way out of a relevance problem.
You can’t creative-test your way out of inbox distrust.
And you can’t volume your way back into permission.
Over the last decade, I’ve worked across hundreds of ecommerce brands, including
companies doing well over $100M per year, where email and SMS contribute 30–60% of total
revenue.
In almost every case, I wasn’t brought in to “improve email marketing.”
I was brought in to stabilize a system that had started behaving unpredictably at scale.
These engagements tend to be long-term. Not because the work is slow, but because the goal
isn’t a spike, it's compounding. This kind of work rarely looks impressive in week one. It
becomes obvious months later, when revenue stops swinging and starts behaving again.
This isn’t for everyone.
If you’re just getting started with email, this won’t be a fit.
If you’re looking for templates, quick wins, or someone to “set up flows,” this won’t be helpful.
And if email isn’t already a meaningful part of your business, there are better places to focus
your energy.
But if email already works and you can feel that it’s starting to lose its edge, that's the window
where this matters most.
Most of this work happens quietly. There’s no big relaunch. No flashy redesign. Just a
re-anchoring of how the system behaves, so it compounds instead of decaying.
If this reflects what you’re seeing, you already know whether a conversation makes sense.

Similar to how https://eurekalabs.ai/ leads into, we need 2 additional websites.
EmailOptimize
A consulting practice focused on stabilizing and compounding email & SMS revenue for
ecommerce brands once scale introduces fragility. This is where I work directly with teams on
sequencing, relevance, and system behavior over time.
Trustalytics.ai
An R&D effort exploring how consumer trust, relevance, and behavioral signals can be
quantified inside email systems. This work is still early, and largely experimental but it informs
how I think about long-term compounding in retention.
